This page contains all the software components that can be used within the StreamPipes framework.
Some of them are mandatory but others are just necessary for a special capabilities.
In the [Installation Guide](user-guide-installation.md#installation_1) we  already provide a docker-compose.yml file with all the necessary components
for a minimal setup.
Extend this configuration files with further containers described on this page and configure StreamPipes
according to your needs.


## StreamPipes Framework

<details class="tip">
<summary>StreamPipes Backend</summary>

#### Description
The StreamPipes Backend is the main component of the StreamPipes Framework. It contains the application logic to create and execute pipelines.
Furthermore, it provides a REST-API that is used by other components for communication.

#### Docker Compose
```yaml
backend:
  image: streampipes/backend
  depends_on:
    - "consul"
  ports:
    - "8030:8030"
  volumes:
    - ./config:/root/.streampipes
    - ./config/aduna:/root/.aduna
  networks:
    spnet:
```
</details>


<details class="tip">
<summary>StreamPipes UI</summary>

#### Description
This service uses nginx and contains the UI of StreamPipes.
The UI can, for example, be used to import new pipeline elements, create new pipelines and manage the pipeline
execution. The UI communicates with the backend via the REST interface.

#### Docker Compose
```yaml
nginx:
  image: streampipes/ui
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  depends_on:
    - backend
  networks:
    spnet:
```
</details>

## StreamPipes Services

<details class="tip">
<summary>Consul</summary>
#### Description
Consul is used to store configuration parameters of the backend service and processing elements.
It is further used for service discovery. Once a processing element container is started in the network, it is
automatically discovered via the service discovery feature of Consul.

#### Docker Compose
```yaml
consul:
    image: consul
    environment:
      - "CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG={\"disable_update_check\": true}"
      - "CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE=eth0"
      - "CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0"
    entrypoint:
      - consul
      - agent
      - -server
      - -bootstrap-expect=1
      - -data-dir=/consul/data
      - -node=consul-one
      - -bind={{ GetInterfaceIP "eth0" }}
      - -client=0.0.0.0
      - -enable-script-checks=true
      - -ui
    volumes:
      - ./config/consul:/consul/data
    ports:
      - "8500:8500"
      - "8600:8600"

<details class="tip">
<summary>Kafka</summary>

#### Description
Kafka is used as the primary message broker. It is possible to use other brokers or even multiple message brokers in a single pipeline, but Kafka is the
default. The communication between the processing elements in a pipeline is mostly done via Kafka.

  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka:0.10.0.1
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"

    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    networks:
      spnet:
```
</details>

<details class="tip">
<summary>ActiveMQ</summary>
#### Description
ActiveMQ is another message broker which can be used in addition to Kafka. Currently, the main purpose is to provide
an endpoint for the websocket connections required by the real-time dashboard of the StreamPipes UI.

#### Docker Compose
```yaml
activemq:
  image: streampipes/activemq
  ports:
    - "61616:61616"
    - "61614:61614"
